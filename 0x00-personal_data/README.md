# 0x00. Personal Data

## Description

This project focuses on back-end authentication and handling personal data. It covers the implementation of a log filter to obfuscate Personally Identifiable Information (PII) fields, encryption of passwords, and authentication to a database using environment variables.

## Resources

- [What Is PII, non-PII, and Personal Data?](https://www.privacytrust.com/glossary/personal-data.html)
- [Logging documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)
- [bcrypt package](https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/)
- [Logging to Files, Setting Levels, and Formatting](https://realpython.com/python-logging/)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Implement a log filter to obfuscate PII fields
- Encrypt a password and validate input passwords
- Authenticate to a database using environment variables

## Requirements

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- All files should end with a newline.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should follow the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5).
- All files must be executable.
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`.
- All modules, classes, and functions should have documentation.
- Documentation should explain the purpose of the module, class, or method in a complete sentence.

## Tasks

- Task 0: Implement a log filter that obfuscates PII fields.
- Task 1: Implement password encryption and validation.
- Task 2: Implement authentication to a database using environment variables.

## Project Timeline

- Project will start on May 29, 2024, at 6:00 AM and must end by May 31, 2024, at 6:00 AM.
- The checker was released on May 29, 2024, at 6:00 PM.
- Manual QA review must be done (request it when you are done with the project).
- An auto review will be launched at the deadline.
